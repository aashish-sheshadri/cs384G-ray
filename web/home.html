			<p>One of the characteristics of art is the exploration of
				expression. For example, dipole painting is a technique based on the
				juxtaposing of two conflicting ideas in order to create meaning.
				Moreover, this technique usually yields interesting composition.
				Inspired by this technique, we explore the use of photo realistic
				and non-photo realistic effects in order to enhance ray tracing.</p>
			<p>List of Accomplishments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A non photo realistic illumination model</li>
				<li>Edge rendering algorithm</li>
				<li>Texture Mapping</li>
				<li>Bump Mapping</li>
				<li>Depth of Field</li>
				<li>Adaptive Sampling</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Photo Realistic Effects</h1>
			<h2>Texture Mapping</h2>
			<p>In order for the audience to determine a rendered object to be real, one must be capable 
			of accurately depicting the intricate characteristics of the object in great detail. The first step to 
			achieve the goal is to seamlessly wrap images of such complex features to simple objects 
			such as	cubes and spheres.</p>
